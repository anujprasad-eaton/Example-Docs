### How to remove all Holograms in one click?

Make sure that you update your HoloLens OS to latest version using broadband internet connection or with a hotspot having good internet speed because this update might be more than 1 GB and it would take lot of time with slow internet. Also make sure that your HoloLens device is connected to power supply (not through PC USB charging but through physical socket) while you are updating the OS and battery level is more than 70%.
 
After this, navigate to **Settings -> System-> Holograms** and you can click on button "Remove all holograms".  my recommendation is to turn the slider to “On” for “Automatically remove all holograms in mixed reality home when device shuts down”. This new setting will help to avoid any case where an application has been left running. To put it to use, be sure to power down the HoloLens by holding the power button until you see “Goodbye” on the screen when you are done using it.
